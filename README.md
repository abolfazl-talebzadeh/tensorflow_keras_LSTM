# HOW TO RUN
There are several jupyter notebook files each of which is designed for a specific version of a model.
the files include:
[1] tensor\_keras\_LSTM.ipynb
[2] tensor\_keras\_LSTM-ver\_1.ipynb
[3] tensor\_keras\_LSTM-ver\_2.ipynb
[4] tensor\_keras\_LSTM-ver\_3.ipynb
[5] tensor\_keras\_LSTM-ver\_2.ipynb
[6] mlClassifierVer1.ipynb
[7] mlClassifierVe2.ipynb
[8] Ensemble\_1.ipynb
[9] Ensemble\_2.ipynb

file number 1 is a practice on a deep learning model which failed
file number 2 is the final deep learning model
file number 3,4,5 are deep learning model containing some modifications
file number 6,7 are two versions of LR model one with an ineffiecient preproccecing method and number seven final LR model
file number 8 is ensemble modle using LR and RF
file number 9 is ensemble method using LR and SVM
please notice due to lack of space the data is not uploaded into the repo, however, the data should be in a folder in the route named /data
